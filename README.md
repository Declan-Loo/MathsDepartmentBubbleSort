# MathsDepartmentBubbleSort
This is a program aimed for the Mathematics department, for Further Maths students.

This program aims to generate random data (either numerical or alphabetic) based on the user's input, so they can be used as sorting exercises for Mathematics students (especially for the students taking the Decision Mathematics 1 module as part of the Edexcel IAL Further Mathematics curriculum). It also contains the sorting algorithm which forms the backbone of the program, and also creates files which can be copy or pasted into Google Docs/Microsoft Word to be used as exercises. This program can take in files and outputs the answer of the data in the file, as well as creating a list of names that can be used for exercises through web-scraping a textfile from GitHub.

TO-DO: Create HTML code for the questions.
